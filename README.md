## 🎯 Project Overview

An intelligent waste segregation system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically classify different types of waste materials. This project aims to contribute to environmental sustainability by automating the waste sorting process, reducing manual effort and improving recycling efficiency.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Image Classification**: Accurate classification of waste into multiple categories
- **CNN Architecture**: Deep learning model optimized for waste recognition
- **Real-time Processing**: Efficient model suitable for real-world applications
